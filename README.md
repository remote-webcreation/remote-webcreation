## My Journey into Web Development  

<br/>

 #### <u>Current Skillset and Focus</u> ️

My current focus is on building a solid foundation in front-end development. I've been working extensively with:

*   **HTML:** Crafting the structure and content of web pages. Practising accessible and well-organized layouts.
*   **CSS:** Styling web pages to create visually appealing and responsive designs. I'm exploring different layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and I'm keen on mastering responsive design principles for optimal viewing across various devices.
