## Hi there and Welcome, I'm Mandy!

#### A Web dev student thrilled to share my progress with you.   

---

##### My current focus is on building a solid foundation in front-end development:

*   **HTML:** Crafting the structure and content of web pages. Practising accessible and well-organized layouts.
*   **CSS:** Styling web pages to create visually appealing and responsive designs. I'm exploring different layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and I'm keen on mastering responsive design principles for optimal viewing across various devices.
