*   **CSS:** Styling web pages to create visually appealing and responsive designs. I'm exploring different layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and I'm keen on mastering responsive design principles for optimal viewing across various devices.

My short-term goals include:

*   Mastering core front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
*   Building a portfolio of diverse and impressive projects.
*   Gaining practical experience through freelance work or internships.
